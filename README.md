# finance
Multiple use cases for financial applications

To structure repo like this:

Creating a well-structured repository for a Python project named "finance" involves organizing your code, documentation, and other project-related files in a systematic and maintainable manner. Here's a suggested structure for your "finance" project:

```
finance/
|-- finance/             # The main Python package
|   |-- __init__.py      # Package initialization
|   |-- core.py          # Core functionality
|   |-- data.py          # Data handling and processing
|   |-- calculations.py  # Financial calculations
|   |-- visualizations.py # Plotting and visualization functions
|
|-- tests/               # Unit tests for your code
|   |-- test_core.py
|   |-- test_data.py
|   |-- test_calculations.py
|   |-- test_visualizations.py
|
|-- docs/                # Documentation for your project
|   |-- index.md         # Main documentation file
|   |-- user_guide.md    # User guide or usage instructions
|   |-- api_reference.md  # API reference
|
|-- examples/            # Example usage of your package
|   |-- example1.py
|   |-- example2.py
|
|-- requirements.txt     # Dependencies for your project
|-- LICENSE              # License file (e.g., MIT, Apache)
|-- README.md            # Project's README
|-- setup.py             # Package installation script
|-- .gitignore           # Git ignore file
|-- .gitattributes       # Git attributes file (if needed)
|-- .travis.yml          # Travis CI configuration (or other CI tools)
|-- .editorconfig        # Editor configuration (optional)
|-- .dockerignore        # Docker ignore file (if using Docker)
|-- .github/             # GitHub-specific files (actions, issue templates, etc.)
|
|-- data/                # Data files used in the project (if applicable)
|
|-- notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks (if you're using them for analysis)
|
|-- scripts/             # Utility scripts (e.g., data scraping, ETL)
|
|-- outputs/             # Output files or results generated by the project

```

This structure follows common best practices for Python projects. You should adjust it based on the specific needs of your "finance" project. Don't forget to include a comprehensive README file explaining how to install and use your package.

Remember to use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your project, and consider using a platform like GitHub for hosting and collaborating on your project. This will make it easier for others to find, use, and contribute to your "finance" project.
